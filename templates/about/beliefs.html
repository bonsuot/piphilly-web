                <h3>The Savior</h3>
                <p>We believe humanity’s need of a Saviour has been met in the person of Jesus Christ, because of His Deity, Virgin Birth, Atoning death, Resurrection (Matthew 28:5-7; Acts 2:24; Acts 2:36; Acts 10:39-40; 1 Corinthians 15:3-4) and Ascension (Acts 1:9-11; Acts 2:33-36), His Abiding Intercession (Romans 8:34; Hebrews 7:25) and His second coming to judge the living and the dead

                <h3>Marriage and Family Life</h3>
                <p>We believe in the institution of marriage as a union established and ordained by God for the lifelong, intimate relationship between a man as husband and a woman as wife as biologically defined at birth. 
                    We believe that God instituted marriage primarily for mutual help, fellowship and comfort that one ought to have for the other and for the honourable procreation of children, and their training in love, 
                    obedience to the Lord and responsible citizenship.</p>
